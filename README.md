#### INTRODUCTION
Plant pathogens are commonly identified in the field by the typical disease symptoms that they can cause. The efficient early detection and identification of pathogens are essential procedures to adopt effective management practices that reduce or prevent their spread to mitigate the negative impacts of the disease. A novel and lightweight YOLOv8n algorithm was introduced to detect leaf disease, merged by the seamless integration of DSConv, improved FasterNeXt, and GIOU modules, meticulously crafted to augment feature extraction efficiency and efficacy.

See below for a quickstart installation and usage example, and see the [YOLOv8 Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com) for full documentation on training, validation, prediction and deployment.

<summary>Install</summary>

Pip install the ultralytics package including all [requirements](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/requirements.txt) in a [**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment with [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ultralytics.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ultralytics) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/ultralytics)](https://pepy.tech/project/ultralytics)

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

For alternative installation methods including [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics), and Git, please refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart).

<summary>Usage</summary>

#### CLI

YOLOv8 may be used directly in the Command Line Interface (CLI) with a `yolo` command:

```bash
yolo predict model=yolov8n.pt source='leaf_disease.jpg'
```

`yolo` can be used for a variety of tasks and modes and accepts additional arguments, i.e. `imgsz=640`. See the YOLOv8 [CLI Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli) for examples.

#### Python

YOLOv8 may also be used directly in a Python environment, and accepts the same [arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/) as in the CLI example above:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8-pn-lightweight.yaml")  # build a new model from scratch
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

# Use the model
model.train(data="DATA.yaml", epochs=100)  # train the model
metrics = model.val()  # evaluate model performance on the validation set
results = model("PATH")  # predict on an image
path = model.export(format="onnx")  # export the model to ONNX format
```

[Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/main/ultralytics/cfg/models) download automatically from the latest Ultralytics [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases). See YOLOv8 [Python Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python) for more examples.
